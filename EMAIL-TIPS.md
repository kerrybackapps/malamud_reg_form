# Email Sending Tips for University Systems

## Why emails might be blocked:

1. **External images**: The original template references an external image
2. **Complex HTML**: Inline CSS and table layouts can trigger filters
3. **Copy-paste issues**: Pasting HTML can add hidden formatting

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Plain Text (Most Reliable)
- Use `email-plain-text.txt`
- Copy and paste as plain text into your email client
- Works with all email systems

### Option 2: Simplified HTML
- Use `email-simple.html`
- Open in browser, copy and paste
- No external images, minimal styling

### Option 3: Direct HTML in Email Client
Some email clients support HTML mode:
- In Outlook: Insert → Text → Object → Text from File
- In Gmail: Enable "Plain text mode" then disable it
- In Thunderbird: Insert → HTML

### Option 4: Use University Email Tools
Many universities have approved mass email tools:
- Check with IT for approved bulk email services
- Use departmental mailing lists
- Request IT whitelist your email format

### Best Practices:
1. **Remove external images** or attach them instead
2. **Test first** - send to yourself or a colleague
3. **Use plain text** for initial contact, HTML for follow-ups
4. **Include both** - some clients show plain text with HTML attachment

### If still blocked:
1. Contact university IT for specific filter rules
2. Request whitelisting for lecture announcements
3. Use official department channels
4. Consider sending through university's official email system
